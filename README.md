# ⭐️ StarGeometryEffect

**StarGeometryEffect** is a SwiftUI project demonstrating the use of `MatchedGeometryEffect` for smooth transitions between views, enhanced with a 3D rotating star animation inspired by the classic Super Mario star. This project showcases the power of SwiftUI’s animation capabilities, custom shapes, and interactive transitions.

## Features
- **MatchedGeometryEffect**: Provides seamless view transitions.
- **Custom Star Shape**: A programmatically drawn star shape inspired by the Super Mario gold star.
- **3D Rotation**: Delayed rotation effect added to the star animation for dynamic interaction.

## Requirements
- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Usage
Explore the interactive star animation by tapping the floating star button in the bottom-right corner. 
The star will smoothly transition between compact and expanded views, utilizing `MatchedGeometryEffect` for the transition. 
Additionally, the star will rotate using a rotation animation when transitioning between compact and expanded views.
